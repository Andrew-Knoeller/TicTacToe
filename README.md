# TicTacToe

Game of TicTacToe written in Python

Files consist of a GameClass file containing the basic logic and Main.py containing the game. If you want to download the Zip and try it out, Let me know if you suggest any changes or find any errors.

User plays by selecting a Row and Column. I accounted for the fact that the computer starts counting at zero so just consider the first row/column number 1. Player "X" plays first in each game but I when I have time I will make it a random choice. Also plan to implement a way to play against the computer instead of making the moves for both player "X" and player "O". Hope you enjoy!
